##Description
The Task Board is a project management application designed to help teams organize and track their project tasks. This application allows users to add, manage, and delete tasks while keeping track of their progress through a dynamic task board interface. Built using jQuery UI and Day.js, this app is both interactive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth task management experience.

##Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to create a functional and visually appealing task management tool. This application demonstrates the use of jQuery UI for interactivity and Day.js for date handling, providing a practical example of these libraries in action.

##Features
Task Management: Add new tasks with titles, descriptions, and deadlines through a modal dialog.
Progress Tracking: Tasks are displayed in columns representing their progress states: Not Yet Started, In Progress, and Completed.
Color Coding: Tasks are color-coded to indicate their urgencyâ€”yellow for nearing deadlines and red for overdue tasks.
Drag-and-Drop: Easily update a task's progress by dragging it to different columns.
Persistence: Tasks are saved in localStorage and persist through page refreshes.
Task Deletion: Remove tasks from the board, and they will not reappear after a refresh.
